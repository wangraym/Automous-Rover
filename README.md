# Automous Rover Project
Developed in the fall of 2017 for MIE444 - Mechatronics Principle course. The goal was to design, build, and program an autonomous rover capable of autonomously meeting the following requirements in a known maze environment:

1) Localize and determine its position in the maze
2) Find the loading zone, where a wooden 2" x 2" x 2" cube is located
3) Pick up the cube and bring it to a drop off zone specified at the start of the run

Additional bonus requirements:

- Complete all the tasks in 60 seconds (+10%)
- Complete all the tasks in 90 seconds (+5%)
- Start the run with an unknown rover orientation (+5%)
- Pick up the blog at a randomly placed location in the loading zone (+15%)

Deductions:

- 5% penalty per obstacle hit or rover 'reset'

In its first evaluation trial, our rover completed all objectives in 64 seconds with an unknown starting orientation!
